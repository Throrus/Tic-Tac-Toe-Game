# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A Tic-Tac-Toe game made with Pygame

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game I wrote with Pygame. 
The game uses a PNG image as the game board and prints the text and markers on top of it.

The font used is FreeSansBold. I originally used the default font provided by Pygame, but 
found that this caused problems when trying to create an executable of the game. FreeSansBold 
was suggested as a comperable font.

For now, the program is run through the command line. I have plans to create an .exe, but that 
will be a later project.

Enjoy!
